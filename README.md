## Introduction
MirHam ImageGenerator is a macOS application for QA Engineers for generating a set of images for software testing purposes.

## Features
- Fast generation
- Up to 100000 images
- Up to 16350 pixels width/height
- Export formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, BMP

## Compatibility

This application is compatible with macOS 14.0 and above.

## Installation

Download the DMG installer from the [releases](https://github.com/mirham/ImageGenerator/releases), mount it, and drag and drop the application to the Applications folder. That's it! However, you will need to allow launching applications from unidentified developers to start the application, as I don't have an Apple developer license.

## Improvement
> [!TIP]
> If you have any ideas, thoughts, or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. I'm happy to help and improve the application.

## Disclaimer
> [!WARNING]
> I'm not a professional Swift developer (though I am a professional .NET developer). All my macOS apps are made for personal use by myself and my family simply because I have the skills to create them (and for fun, of course ðŸ˜Š). If my application has caused any harm, I apologize for that, but please be aware that you use it at your own risk.
